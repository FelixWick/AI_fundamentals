      "Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, which involves iteratively adjusting the connections between neurons (nodes) to minimize the error between their outputs and the desired target values. The learning process begins with a dataset of input-output pairs, where each input is propagated forward through the network, activating the neurons and computing an output. The difference between this output and the target value is then computed, known as the \"loss\" or \"error.\" This error is then backpropagated backwards through the network, updating the weights and biases of each connection based on the gradient of the loss with respect to each parameter. This process is repeated for multiple iterations, with the network adjusting its internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the average error across all training examples. As the network refines its internal representations and learns to map inputs to outputs more accurately, it becomes better at generalizing to new, unseen data.\n",
